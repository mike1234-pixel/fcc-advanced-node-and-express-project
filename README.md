This is a Live Chat App with User Registration, Login and Social Authentication with Github.

The project is a _Node/Express_ application which uses _passport.js_ for authentication and _socket.io_ for live chat. The frontend is created with _pug templates_ and the _Material Design Bootstrap_.

# User Stories

Users can register an account and log in to the live chat using that account, _or_ they can login using their Github account.

All logged in users can engage in live chat.

# Working Locally
