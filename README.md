This is a Live Chat App with User Registration, Login and Social Authentication with Github.

The project is a _Node/Express_ application which uses _passport.js_ for authentication and _socket.io_ for live chat. The frontend is created with _pug templates_ and the _Material Design Bootstrap_.

# User Stories

Users can register an account and log in to the live chat using that account, _or_ they can login using their Github account.

All logged in users can engage in live chat.

# Run In Repl.it

- Click the Run button at the top of the screen.
- Copy the url in the top right hand corner and paste into a new browser window.
- Repl.it is now running the app on a live server, meaning that anyone can access this app with the url https://live-chat-app--michaeltandy.repl.co/ and are able to register and login to the live chat.
- The application will automatically timeout and stop running after 30 minutes-1 hour of inactivity, so don't worry if you close your browser and leave the app running as it will turn itself off.
